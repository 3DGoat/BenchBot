# BenchBot
A large format 3D printer built specifically for a workbench. 
Use files at your own risk, this is just a place I will randomly dump files, so they may not be up to date and/or tested.

Main sheet metal parts can be used on almost any length of aluminum extrusion.
Openbuilds 20x20,20x40 is suggested for this build.
Sheet metal parts can be printed, but for best rigidity sheet metal would be suggested.
