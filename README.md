# BenchBot
A large format 3D printer built specifically for a workbench. If files are marked experimental or untested that means that I have not tested them or they do not work. If files are unmarked you can assume that they will work.

Main sheet metal parts can be used on almost any length of aluminum extrusion.
Openbuilds 20x20,20x40 is suggested for this build. All metal parts are made for M5 screws and cheap v-slot wheels found on amazon
Sheet metal parts can be printed, but for best rigidity sheet metal would be suggested.
